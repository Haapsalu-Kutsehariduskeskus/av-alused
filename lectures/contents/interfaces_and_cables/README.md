## Network Protocols

Agreed upon system of communicating between network devices.

## Bits and Bytes

* Bit = `0` or `1`
* Byte = 8 bits

### Speed

![Speed is measured in bits per second](docs/bit_speeds.png)

## Ethernet

Collection of network protocols/standards that fit in RJ-45 ports.

* **RJ = "Registered Jack"**

## Cable Standards

* defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983
* **IEEE** = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

## Copper UTP Cables

Type of copper **cables** used in ethernet standards.

* `Unshielded` = no metallic shield, which makes them vulnerable to **electrical** interference
* `Twisted Pair` = Literaly 4 pairs of wires with each pair twisted together, protecting against EMI (**Electromagnetic** Interference)
* `8 pins`, perfect for the number of wires
* **Not all ethernet cables use all 8 wires**

### Copper cable standards

![Copper ethernet cable standards](docs/copper_ethernet_standards.png)

* **"BASE"** refers to baseband signaling (outside of CCNA scope) and **"T"** refers to *"twisted pair"*

### 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T

* `Full-Duplex` transmission: both connected devices can receive and transmit data at the same time

#### Straight-through cable connections

```log
1 --- 1
2 --- 2

3 --- 3
6 --- 6
```

#### Crossover cable connections

```log
1 --- 3
2 --- 6

3 --- 1
6 --- 2
```

#### **Auto MDI-X** ðŸ”¥

Truth is that most modern network devices don't need to worry about straight-through or crossover cables because of Auto MDI-X.

It allows deviced to automatically detect which pins their neighbor is transmiting data on, and then adjust which pins to use to transmit/receive data.

### 1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T

In addition to using **ALL** pairs of wires, each pair is `BI-DIRECTIONAL`. This is part of the reason why they can operate at much faster speeds.

```log
1 --- 1
2 --- 2

3 --- 3
6 --- 6

4 --- 4
5 --- 5

7 --- 7
8 --- 8
```

## Fiber-optic UTP Cables

![](docs/sfp_transceiver.png)

### Connections

![](docs/fiber_cable.png)

![](docs/fiber_optic_layers.png)

* `1` : Fiber glass core, where light is transmitted
* `2` : Cladding that reflects light
* `3` : Protective buffer
* `4` : Outer jacket of the cable

#### Single-mode

* Narrower core than multimode
* Single angle (mode) from laser-based transmitter
* Allows longer cables than UTP and multimode
* More expensive than    multimode fiber (**laser-based sfp transmitters**)

![](docs/single-mode_fiber.png)

#### Multimode

* Wider fiber glass core than single-mode fiber
* Allows multiple angles (modes) of light waves to enter the fiber glass core
* Allows longer cables than UTP
* Shorter cables than single-mode fiber
* Cheaper than single-mode fiber (**led-based sfp transmitters**)

### Fiber-optic Cable standards

![](docs/fiber_optic_standards.png)

## UTP vs Fiber-optic Cabling

| UTP | Fiber-optic |
| :-: | :-: |
| Cheaper | More expensive |
| Shorter max distance (~100m) | Longer max distance |
| Vulnerable to EMI | EMI proof |
| RJ45 ports are cheaper than SFP ports | SFP ports are more expensive (and single-mode ir more expensive than multimode) |
| Leak faint signal outside of cable (security risk) | No signal leak |
