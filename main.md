**Enhance Your Networking Skills for the Digital Age**  
Networking is the backbone of the modern digital world. Whether you’re pursuing a career in cybersecurity, software development, or IT management, understanding how networks function, how to configure them, and how to protect them is essential.

## Overview

This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer networks, covering network architectures, models, protocols, and essential networking components. 
As networks are critical to various business operations, from data management to cybersecurity, 
this course will equip you with the skills needed to perform basic configurations on routers and switches and develop a solid understanding of IP addressing schemes, both IPv4 and IPv6.

By the end of this course, you will be prepared to configure and troubleshoot small networks, making it an excellent starting point in HKHK.

## You'll Learn These Core Skills:
- Build simple LANs, perform basic configurations for routers and switches, and implement IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes.
- Configure routers, switches, and end devices to provide access to local and remote network resources, ensuring end-to-end connectivity between remote devices.
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills using real equipment and Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Configure and troubleshoot connectivity in a small network using security best practices.
