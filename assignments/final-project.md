   - PC1: 192.168.1.10 /24
   - PC2: 192.168.1.20 /24
3. Connect both PCs to the switch using copper straight-through cables.
4. Test network connectivity by pinging from PC1 to PC2.
5. Document the following:
   - The IP addressing used for each device.
   - The steps you took to configure and connect the devices.
   - A screenshot of a successful ping between the two PCs.

**Deliverables**:  
- A brief report (1-2 pages) detailing the network setup, configurations, and results.
- A Packet Tracer file (.pkt) showing your network design.
- A screenshot of the successful ping results.

**Assessment Criteria**:
