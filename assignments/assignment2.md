## Assignment 2: Subnetting and IP Addressing

**Title**: Subnetting and IP Addressing

**Objective**:
- Demonstrate understanding of IPv4 addressing and subnetting.
- Calculate and apply subnetting to a given network scenario.

**Instructions**:
1. Given an IP address range, calculate the necessary subnets to support a network with multiple departments (e.g., Admin, Sales, IT).
2. Design a network in Packet Tracer that uses your calculated subnets.
3. Assign IP addresses to all devices according to your subnetting plan.
4. Verify connectivity between devices in different subnets using Ping.

**Deliverables**:
- A written report with your subnet calculations and explanation.
- A Packet Tracer file (`.pkt`) of your network design.
- A brief video (optional) demonstrating connectivity testing between subnets.

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Accuracy of subnetting calculations (40%).
- Correct IP configuration and connectivity (50%).
- Quality of the report (10%).

**Submission Details**:
- Submit your report, Packet Tracer file, and video (if included) to the GitHub repository under `/assignments/assignment2/` by the due date.
