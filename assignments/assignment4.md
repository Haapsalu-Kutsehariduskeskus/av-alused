## Assignment 4: Network Security and Basic Routing

**Title**: Network Security and Basic Routing

**Objective**:
- Apply network security practices to secure a small network.
- Implement basic static routing to enable communication between different subnets.

**Instructions**:
1. **Network Security**:
   - Using the network from previous assignments, configure SSH access to your router and switch.
   - Implement security measures, such as setting strong passwords, disabling unused ports, and configuring basic access control lists (ACLs).

2. **Basic Routing**:
   - Configure static routes on your network to ensure connectivity between different subnets.
   - Test the routing by using Ping and Traceroute to verify that devices in different subnets can communicate.

3. **Verification**:
   - Verify that your security settings are correctly implemented and that routing between subnets is functional.
   - Document any issues encountered during the configuration and how they were resolved.

**Deliverables**:
- A written report detailing your network security configurations and routing setup.
- A Packet Tracer file (`.pkt`) showing the complete network with security measures and static routing.
- Screenshots showing key configurations and successful communication between subnets.

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Implementation of network security practices (50%).
- Correct configuration of static routing (30%).
- Quality and clarity of the report (20%).

**Submission Details**:
- Submit your report, Packet Tracer file, and screenshots to the GitHub repository under `/assignments/assignment4/` by the due date.

**Deadline**: [Insert Date]
