# Assignment 1: Understanding IP Addressing and Subnetting
**Title**: Introduction to IP Addressing and Subnetting

**Objective**:  
Understand the basics of IP addressing and subnetting, and practice creating subnets for a small network.

**Instructions**:  
1. Research the structure of IPv4 addresses and subnet masks.
2. Describe the difference between public and private IP addresses.
3. Design a small network that requires subnetting for at least 4 different departments (e.g., Sales, HR, IT, and Admin) using private IP addresses.
4. Calculate the subnet addresses and provide the subnet mask for each department.
5. Document your process and calculations.

**Deliverables**:  
- A written report explaining IP addressing and subnetting.
- Subnet calculations, including network address, first host, last host, and broadcast address for each subnet.
  
**Assessment Criteria**:
- Understanding of IP addressing and subnetting (40%).
- Accuracy of subnet calculations (40%).
- Clarity and completeness of the report (20%).
