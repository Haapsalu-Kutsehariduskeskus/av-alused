# Assignment 3: Introduction to Network Topologies
**Title**: Basic Network Topologies and Their Use Cases

**Objective**:  
Understand common network topologies and their use cases in real-world scenarios.

**Instructions**:  
1. Research the different types of network topologies (e.g., Star, Ring, Bus, Mesh).
2. Identify a real-world use case for each topology.
3. Use a diagramming tool (e.g., Lucidchart, draw.io) to create a visual representation of each topology.
4. Document the pros and cons of each topology and explain why a particular topology might be used in a specific situation.

**Deliverables**:  
- A written report explaining each topology and its use case.
- Diagrams representing each topology.

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Understanding of network topologies (40%).
- Accuracy and clarity of diagrams (40%).
- Clarity and completeness of the report (20%).

**Submission Details**:
